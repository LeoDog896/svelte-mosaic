# svelte-mosaic

port of [react-mosaic](https://github.com/nomcopter/react-mosaic) to Svelte.

## API

A `Node` is compromised of two siblings, `alpha` and `beta`.
These two homogeneous siblings are the only two children of `Node`.
However, a sibling can be a `Node` itself, creating a recursive tree structure.
